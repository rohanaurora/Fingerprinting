Features
========

Adapts `NSOutputStream`'s API for use to generate SHA1 digests.

Also provides convenience methods for:

* Directly hashing a lump of data: `-[NSData ks_SHA1Digest]`.
* Hashing the contents of a URL, even a remote one: `+SHA1DigestOfContentsOfURL:`
* Converting a digest into a hexadecimal string representation: `+ks_stringFromSHA1Digest:`

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/KSCrypto or message me on Twitter.

Dependencies
============

Usage
=====

1. Add `KSSHA1Stream.h` and `KSSHA1Stream.m` to your project. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, but hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.
2. Link against `CommonCrypto`

To hash a stream of data:

1. `[[KSSHA1Stream alloc] init]`
2. Call `-write:maxLength:` as your data arrives. `KSSHA1Stream` promises to always process all bytes passed to it
3. Call `-close` on the stream
4. Retrieve the result using the `SHA1Digest` property
